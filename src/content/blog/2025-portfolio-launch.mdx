{/* # Portfolio Relaunch — React, Vite, and MDX */}

I recently rebuilt my personal portfolio from the ground up using a modern frontend stack — optimized for speed, content flexibility, and professional polish.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 19** — modern UI logic with hooks and transitions  
- **Vite 7** — blazing-fast dev environment and bundler  
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling, fully customized  
- **MDX** — write blog posts in Markdown + React  
- **Vercel** — zero-config deployment with a custom domain

---

## ✨ Highlights

- MDX-powered blog with dynamic routes and tag filtering  
- SEO-ready with Open Graph images and sitemap  
- Dark mode, responsive layout, and syntax highlighting  
- RSS feed and copy-to-clipboard for code snippets  
- Custom domain deployed via GitHub + Vercel + GoDaddy

---

## 🎯 Why the Redesign?

My old site didn’t reflect where I am today as a frontend engineer.  
This relaunch better showcases:

- My technical skills  
- My design sense  
- My ability to write and share clearly  

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

I learned a lot through this rebuild and plan to share more tutorials and breakdowns soon.
