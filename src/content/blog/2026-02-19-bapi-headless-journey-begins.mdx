## The Challenge

In October 2025, I joined **BAPI** (Building Automation Products, Inc.) as a web developer with a clear mission: migrate their **16-year-old WordPress site** to a modern headless architecture.

This wasn't just a "nice to have" refresh. The existing site was:

- Slow (2-3 second page loads)
- Difficult to maintain (legacy plugins, inline styles everywhere)
- Limited in scalability (couldn't easily expand to new markets)
- Held back by outdated UX patterns

But here's the catch: we couldn't just rebuild from scratch. We had **608 products**, years of technical documentation, established SEO rankings, and existing customers relying on the site daily.

## Why Headless?

**Headless CMS** means separating the content management layer (WordPress) from the presentation layer (Next.js). Think of it like this:

```
Traditional WordPress
┌──────────────────────┐
│   WordPress          │
│   ├── Content        │
│   ├── Presentation   │ ← Everything tightly coupled
│   └── Business Logic │
└──────────────────────┘

Headless Architecture
┌──────────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────────┐
│   WordPress          │      │   Next.js            │
│   ├── Content ─────────────→│   ├── Presentation   │
│   └── API (GraphQL)  │      │   └── Business Logic │
└──────────────────────┘      └──────────────────────┘
```

**The benefits for BAPI:**

- **Performance**: Pre-rendered pages, optimized images, edge caching
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling, TypeScript, component-based architecture
- **Flexibility**: Same content, multiple frontends (web, mobile app, etc.)
- **Security**: WordPress admin isolated from public site
- **Scalability**: Handle traffic spikes, expand to new markets easily

---

## The Architecture

Here's the tech stack I landed on:

**Backend (Content Management):**

- **WordPress 6.8.2** - Content editing interface
- **WooCommerce 10.3.5** - Product catalog & order management
- **WPGraphQL** - Modern GraphQL API for WordPress
- **Kinsta** - Managed WordPress hosting with Redis

**Frontend (Presentation Layer):**

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety across the entire codebase
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **GraphQL Code Generator** - Auto-generated TypeScript types
- **Vercel** - Edge deployment with global CDN

**Key Features Built:**

- Multi-step checkout with Stripe integration
- Real-time product search across 600+ items
- 11-language internationalization with next-intl
- 12 regions with automatic currency conversion
- WordPress JWT authentication (no third-party service needed)
- Complete user dashboard with order history

---

## The Scope of Work

Let me give you a sense of what this migration actually entailed:

**Product Catalog:**

- 608 WooCommerce products
- 15 product taxonomies (categories, attributes, specifications)
- Hierarchical category structure (6 levels deep)
- Variable products with multiple variations
- Custom B2B pricing fields

**Content:**

- 112 pages migrated from Visual Composer
- 61 application notes (custom post type)
- Service bulletins, datasheets, technical documentation
- Blog posts, case studies, and resources

**Infrastructure:**

- 11 languages (EN, DE, FR, ES, JA, ZH, VI, AR, TH, PL, HI)
- 12 regions with currency support
- 1,100+ translation keys
- Dynamic sitemap generation
- SEO metadata for every page

**E-commerce Features:**

- Shopping cart with real-time updates
- Multi-step checkout wizard
- Stripe payment processing
- Order confirmation emails
- Account dashboard with order history
- Quote request system with file uploads

---

## Early Wins

Four months in, here's what we've achieved:

**Performance:**

- 95% faster page loads (2-3s → &lt;100ms cached)
- 96% improvement in GraphQL query times (6.7s → 258ms)
- Lighthouse scores: 95+ across all metrics

**Developer Experience:**

- Full TypeScript coverage with auto-generated types
- 648 passing tests with 80%+ code coverage
- Component library with Storybook documentation
- CI/CD pipeline with automated deployments

**Production Results:**

- 3 successful test orders placed (100% success rate)
- WooCommerce integration working end-to-end
- Real customer data syncing correctly
- All product pages rendering properly

## Key Lessons Learned

**1. Don't Fight the Monolith**
WordPress has been around for 20+ years for a reason. Instead of replacing it entirely, I leveraged its strengths (content management, WooCommerce) and built a modern frontend on top.

**2. Type Safety is Non-Negotiable**
With 600+ products and complex data structures, TypeScript caught countless bugs before they reached production. The GraphQL Code Generator was a game-changer.

**3. Performance Requires Multiple Layers**
It's not just frontend optimization—you need caching at every level:

- WordPress: Redis object cache + WPGraphQL Smart Cache
- Next.js: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) + React cache()
- Vercel: Edge caching + CDN

**4. Start Simple, Add Complexity**
I began with basic product pages, then added filtering, then search, then checkout. Each layer built on the previous foundation.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. In upcoming posts, I'll dive deep into:

- **GraphQL Performance Optimization** - How I achieved 96% faster queries
- **Building a Type-Safe Cart with Zustand** - Local-first architecture with Stripe
- **Internationalization at Scale** - 11 languages, 12 regions, AI-powered translations
- **Authentication Without Third-Party Services** - WordPress JWT implementation
- **Storybook for Headless WordPress** - Component-driven development

## The Reality of Migration Work

Here's what they don't tell you about migrating legacy systems:

**You'll spend 40% of your time** understanding existing data structures, legacy code patterns, and business requirements.

**You'll spend 30% of your time** on performance optimization, caching strategies, and database queries.

**You'll spend 20% of your time** on the "exciting" new features.

**You'll spend 10% of your time** documenting everything so the next developer doesn't have to reverse-engineer your work.

And you know what? **That's exactly how it should be.** Professional development isn't about greenfield projects—it's about making smart technical decisions in the context of real business constraints.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Migrating a 16-year-old WordPress site to headless architecture is ambitious. It's messy. It's challenging. And it's **exactly** the kind of work that makes you a better developer.

Every decision has tradeoffs. Every optimization has context. Every feature requires balancing user needs, business requirements, and technical constraints.

But when you see those Lighthouse scores hit 95+, when customers successfully check out, when the marketing team can update content without calling IT—**that's** when you know it was worth it.
