Welcome to the relaunch of my personal website and blog! 🚀

Over the last few weeks, I rebuilt this site from the ground up using a modern frontend stack and a strong focus on performance, SEO, and developer experience.

## 🚧 Why the Redesign?

My previous portfolio felt outdated and lacked the performance and flexibility I wanted. I needed something:

- ⚡ Clean and fast  
- 🧩 Easy to maintain and extend  
- 📝 Blog-ready with MDX and full SEO control  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights

- **React** — Component-based UI  
- **Vite** — Lightning-fast builds  
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first, scalable styling  
- **MDX** — Markdown + JSX = flexible content  
- **Vercel** — Seamless deploys, CDN, and HTTPS  

## ✨ New Features

- 🔍 Blog search and tag filtering  
- 💡 Copy-to-clipboard buttons for code snippets  
- 🌓 Dark mode with syntax highlighting  
- 📄 Custom 404 and SPA routing  
- 📡 SEO, Open Graph, and RSS support  
- 🌐 Deployed on a custom GoDaddy domain via Vercel  

## 💭 Lessons Learned

- MDX makes writing dev content enjoyable  
- Tailwind pairs well with clean component structure  
- Vercel’s DX is hard to beat  
- Details like OG images and RSS boost site credibility
