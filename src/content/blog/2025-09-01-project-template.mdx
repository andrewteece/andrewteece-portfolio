# Why Every Developer Needs a Project Template

Starting a new project should be exciting. But too often, it begins with hours of repetitive setup: configuring ESLint, wiring Prettier, adding CI, setting up Husky hooks, and installing testing libraries. Before youâ€™ve even written a single line of app code, youâ€™re already bogged down in boilerplate.

Thatâ€™s where a **project template** comes in.

## What is this series?

This post is the first in a multi-part series where I break down the **Project Template repo** I use to kickstart professional web apps. Each post will focus on a specific piece of the setup, showing you exactly how it fits together and why it matters.

ðŸ“‚ **Source code:** [andrewteece/project-template](https://github.com/andrewteece/project-template)

Upcoming parts:

- **CI/CD & Green by Construction**
- **Flat ESLint Config + Prettier + Husky**
- **Testing with Vitest & Providers Helper**
- **Path Aliases with vite-tsconfig-paths**
- **Tailwind v4 Zero-Config Mode**
- **Branch Protection & Best Practices**

By the end, youâ€™ll see how each piece contributes to a template thatâ€™s _green by construction_ â€” meaning `main` always passes checks before merge.

## Why bother with a template?

A solid project template:

- **Removes repetition** â€” no more copy/pasting configs from old repos.
- **Prevents mistakes** â€” linting, typechecking, and tests are built in.
- **Speeds onboarding** â€” new teammates clone, install, and ship within minutes.
- **Standardizes quality** â€” every project starts at the same professional baseline.

Think of it as your **personal framework**: curated tools, scripts, and workflows that let you focus on _building features_ instead of _configuring tooling_.

## Whatâ€™s inside this template?

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve included:

- **Next.js 15** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind v4** (config-less mode)
- **ESLint flat config** + Prettier
- **Vitest + Testing Library** with `renderWithProviders` helper
- **Husky + lint-staged** pre-commit checks
- **GitHub Actions CI** (Prettier â†’ Lint â†’ Typecheck â†’ Tests â†’ Coverage)

Everything is designed to work together, so you can trust that every commit to `main` is production-ready.

## Up Next

In **Part 2**, Iâ€™ll show how the CI pipeline is built: caching pnpm, installing Node, running checks, and using branch protections to keep your repo green by construction.
