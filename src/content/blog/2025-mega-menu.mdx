## Why this project?

I built this mega-menu as a **self-contained demo** to showcase how I approach a real-world UI challenge: information-dense navigation that remains fast, accessible, and elegant. It’s not part of my portfolio site’s nav — this is a **standalone case study project**.

## Goals

- **Responsive UX**: Multi-column desktop layout, clean mobile fallback  
- **A11y first**: Full keyboard navigation, visible focus, ARIA states  
- **Motion with purpose**: Subtle easing, reduced-motion support  
- **Data-driven**: Config-driven menu structure for flexibility  
- **Themeable**: Works with light/dark via CSS variables  

## Tech Stack

- **React** for composable components and state  
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent styling  
- **Framer Motion** for animations and micro-interactions  
- **TypeScript** for type-safe config and props  

## Takeaways
This demo shows how to blend structure, accessibility, and motion into a cohesive navigation experience. The same approach scales to e-commerce, docs portals, or enterprise dashboards.

## Information Architecture

The menu is powered by a **typed config object** instead of hardcoded markup:

```ts
export type MegaMenuItem = {
  label: string;
  href?: string;
  columns?: Array<{
    heading?: string;
    links: Array<{ label: string; href: string; icon?: JSX.Element }>;
  }>;
};
