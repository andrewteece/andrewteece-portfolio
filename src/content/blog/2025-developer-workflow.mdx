## Why this system?

As a frontend developer juggling **freelance projects, portfolio builds, job applications, and ongoing learning**, I needed more than sticky notes and scattered apps.  
I needed a system — a professional-grade workflow that would scale as my work grew.  

So I built a **Developer HQ**: a centralized setup that connects **Notion, Todoist, Notion Calendar, GitHub, and Raycast** into one streamlined workflow.

---

## The Tools I Use

- **Notion** → Developer HQ dashboard (Projects, Job Apps, Learning, Content)  
- **Todoist** → task manager and universal inbox  
- **Notion Calendar** → time-blocked schedule with deep work & job search slots  
- **GitHub** → repos, issues, and PR tracking  
- **Raycast** → productivity launcher tying everything together  

---

## How It Works (Daily Ritual)

> **Morning:**  
> - Open **Notion Calendar** → review today’s blocks  
> - Open **Todoist “Today”** → confirm tasks  
> - Clear inbox → triage into Projects or Quick Capture  

> **During Work Blocks:**  
> - 🟧 **Coding** → focus on freelance work, portfolio projects, or Frontend Mentor builds  
> - 🟦 **Job Search** → recruiter calls, applications, interviews  
> - 🟩 **Content** → writing blog posts, LinkedIn updates, or portfolio refinements  

> **End of Day:**  
> - Mark tasks complete in Todoist  
> - Capture learnings into Notion  
> - Check tomorrow’s Calendar

## Visual System

- **Developer HQ Dashboard** → central Notion page with Projects, Quick Capture, Resources, and Review sections  
- **Custom Icons & Covers** → branded to match my portfolio aesthetic  
- **Notion Calendar** → color-coded time blocks (🟧 Coding, 🟦 Job Search, 🟩 Content, 🟨 Personal)  
- **Raycast Extensions** → add tasks, open repos, and jump into Calendar with one keystroke  

---

## The Results

- Clear separation between **freelance work, portfolio builds, job search, and content**  
- Fewer missed tasks → everything captured in Todoist  
- Weekly reviews keep projects moving forward  
- A branded, professional system that reflects how I work as a developer  

The result? **Less stress, more focus, and a workflow I can scale as my projects and career grow.**

## Closing

If you’re a developer (or any creative), don’t just build projects — **build your system**.  
It’s what lets you deliver consistently, stay focused, and show up like a pro.
