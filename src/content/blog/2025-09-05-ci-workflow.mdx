# Project Template Series Part 2: CI/CD & Green by Construction

In **Part 1** of this series, I explained why every developer benefits from starting with a project template.
Now in **Part 2**, we‚Äôll look at the **CI/CD pipeline** that makes this template _green by construction_.

üìÇ **Source code:** [andrewteece/project-template](https://github.com/andrewteece/project-template)

## What does ‚Äúgreen by construction‚Äù mean?

It means that **every change is verified before merging into `main`**. If the code doesn‚Äôt meet standards‚Äîformatting, linting, type checks, tests, coverage‚Äîit never lands. This keeps `main` deployable 100% of the time.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI pipeline lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs on every push and pull request:

1. **Checkout** code
2. **Install dependencies** with pnpm (using `packageManager` pin)
3. **Prettier check** for formatting issues
4. **ESLint check** with zero warnings allowed
5. **TypeScript typecheck**
6. **Vitest run with coverage**

Only if _all_ pass does a branch qualify to merge.

```yaml
- name: Prettier
  run: pnpm prettier --check .

- name: Lint
  run: pnpm eslint . --max-warnings=0

- name: Typecheck
  run: pnpm run typecheck

- name: Tests (coverage)
  run: pnpm run test:coverage
```

## Branch protection

To enforce this pipeline, `main` has GitHub branch protection enabled:

- ‚úÖ Require pull requests
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution

This guarantees that no unreviewed or failing code ever reaches production.

---

## Why this matters

Without CI/CD guardrails, bugs, style issues, and broken builds slip into `main`.
By contrast, with a **green-by-construction template**, every project starts with:

- Confidence that `main` is always deployable
- Faster PR reviews (checks catch issues before humans do)
- Cleaner history and fewer firefights

## Up Next

In **Part 3**, we‚Äôll dive into **Flat ESLint config + Prettier + Husky hooks**, showing how local and staged checks complement CI to enforce code quality before commits even leave your machine.
