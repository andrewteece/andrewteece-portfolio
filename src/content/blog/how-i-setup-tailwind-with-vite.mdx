Setting up Tailwind CSS with Vite is a clean and efficient way to style modern web apps. In this post, I'll show you exactly how I configured it in my portfolio — including dark mode, utility classes, and performance tips.

---

## 🔧 1. Install Tailwind with Vite

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This creates `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` in the root of your project.

---

## 📁 2. Configure `tailwind.config.js`

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This sets up file scanning and enables the `class`-based dark mode strategy.

---

## 🎨 3. Add Tailwind to your CSS

In `src/styles/index.css` (or similar), add:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then import this CSS into your entry point, usually in `main.tsx`:

```ts
import './styles/index.css';
```

---

## 🌙 4. Enable Dark Mode

I use a custom `ThemeProvider` and a toggle button component. Tailwind automatically applies `.dark` styles using the `class` strategy:

```tsx
<div className="bg-white text-black dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:text-white">
  ...
</div>
```

This allows theme switching without using the OS preference.

---

## ✨ 5. Extra Enhancements

These are bonus improvements that help polish the experience:

- Add `@tailwindcss/typography` for prose styling
- Customize theme colors and fonts using `theme.extend`
- Enable JIT (Just-in-Time mode is on by default in Vite)
- Add `preload` for fonts and images in your HTML
- Use `clsx` or `classnames` for conditional utility classes

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Tailwind CSS with Vite is a powerful combination that keeps your styling lean and consistent across components. I use this stack on every new project — and love how fast the dev experience is.
