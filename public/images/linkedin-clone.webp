# This would be the LinkedIn Clone screenshot converted to WebP format  
# Since I cannot process the actual image file, this is a placeholder
# You would need to:
# 1. Save the LinkedIn clone screenshot as linkedin-clone.webp
# 2. Optimize it for web (recommended size: 1200x630px or similar) 
# 3. Place it in this location
